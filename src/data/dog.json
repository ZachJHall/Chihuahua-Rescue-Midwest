    "name": "Baranby",
    "descr": "Barnaby is a young male who is looking for a safe forever home. He is about 10 pounds and is about 1 yr old. This boy is very sweet and really wants to trust someone. He tends to be afraid of men so a single woman may be best to be his mom. With time, he will trust and love you enormously. We are not sure of his past as he was brought in by animal control. But, his foster mom says he is opening up more and more every day. Barnaby loves to play so if you have another dog who could be a sibling for him, he would love that. He does not discriminate and loves all dogs, big or small. We are currently making strides towards leash walking and potty training. Since he is young, we know he will master these things very quickly. We can already see he is very smart."
